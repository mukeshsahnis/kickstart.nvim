# Nvim Config

This is a fork of: kickstart.nvim
https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim

## Merging changes from upstream

I have changed the name of the main branch. It's called `main` in my fork. This is to run `just` commands which expect the HEAD branch to be `main`.

```
git checkout -b merge-original
git pull original master
```
